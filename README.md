Epitech Blih, but in Rust.

Feel free to make an issue if you encounter problem.

# Usage

Same as the *official* blih cli.

# Dev Usage

The repo contain both a lib crate and a bin crate. The bin is juste a cli wrapper for the lib, it is quite simple. All the code is the blih_rs folder.

```toml
[dependencies]
blih_rs = "0.0.5"
```
